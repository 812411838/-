# 基于深度学习的舌苔检测毕设
本课题利用的是机器学习中比较热门的深度学习方法，结合中医理论对舌苔数据进行标注制作舌苔数据集，利用efficientNet网络实现对舌象图片的图像分类，能够较为精准的分辨多种舌象特征，对照中医经验，对体质进行诊断，从而能够判断人体健康状态，给出身体病症信息，实现了普通用户能够借助计算机对舌苔进行检测分析并结合中医理论和经验推断出用户自身的体质状况。

# Graduation design of tongue coating detection based on deep learning
The graduation design of tongue coating detection based on deep learning This project uses the popular deep learning method in machine learning, labels the tongue coating data in combination with the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, and makes the tongue coating data set. It uses the efficientNet network to realize the image classification of tongue image images, which can accurately distinguish various tongue image features, and diagnose the constitution by comparing the experience of traditional Chinese medicine, so as to judge the health status of human body, The information of physical diseases is given, which enables ordinary users to detect and analyze the tongue coating with the help of computers and infer the physical condition of users based on the theory and experience of traditional Chinese medicine.
